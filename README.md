## A Simulated Blind Auction Smart Contract Implementation Using Substrate

This project implements a simple smart contract for blind auction, currently only simulated(virtual) coin (i.e., bidder's input value) is used as collateral.


### TODOs
1. Implement real coin transfer method using substrate's Balance runtime module.
2. Implement hash check function of type sha3-keccak256.
